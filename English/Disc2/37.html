<p class="italic"><a name="lower"></a>Cloud and the others arrive at lower Junon.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Woman</b><br/>They say Shinra's gathering Huge Materia from around the world and bringing it to Junon.<br/>Bringing it to Junon must mean they want to use their airplanes.<br/>I've noticed there's been a lot of Shinra ships recently. I think they're going to the off-shore Underwater Reactor.<br/>Isn't Shinra trying to transport the Reactor's Huge Materia?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Older Man</b><br/>I remember years ago, seein' the Shinra build a long pipe underwater.<br/>The underwater reactor is connected to Junon by a pipe.<br/>You should be able to get to the reactor through it.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Priscilla</b><br/>Who are you---?<br/>Cloud!!<br/>Stupid jerk! Look how much you made me worry!! Were you at the Lifestream?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Yeah, that's right.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Priscilla</b><br/>You've gotta be more careful! Because you're going to marry me one day.</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud takes the elevator to Upper Junon.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier on the Path to the Airport</b><br/>The Shinra's collecting Huge Materia at the Junon Undersea Reactor!<br/>When they're done, they'll bring it to this airport.<br/>Get out of here before you get in the way!<br/>What... me? I'm gonna be watching from here, so that I don't get in their way either!</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud runs outside to the airport.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier</b><br/>After they get it, they'll take it to the airport and will transport it to Rocket Town by Gelnika. Don't let your guard down!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier 2</b><br/>They've finally started collecting the Huge Materia from the Junon Underwater Reactor.</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud leaves the base and starts down the street, then stops and turns to his companions. Behind them, the Junon cannon is no longer visible.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>I may be mistaken, but...... Doesn't it feel like we're missing something?</p>
<p class="italic"><a name="reactor"></a>Cloud and the others continue on. On the path to the reactor, they come across a commander drilling his soldiers.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Commander</b><br/>All right!! Let's see how hard you trained!<br/>Attention! Charge--!!</p>
<p class="italic">The soldiers all charge in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Commander</b><br/>He... hey--!! That's the Underwater Reactor!! Come back!!</p>
<p class="italic">The commander runs after them. At the end of the path, Cloud gets on an elevator with two soldiers and a redhead.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier</b><br/>How 'bout, whoever stays alive, gets to take her out?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier 2</b><br/>All right, you're on!!<br/>But... What if both of us...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier</b><br/>Whoa!! Don't even talk about that!</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud defeats both of them.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Redhead</b><br/>...gulp... (Great... there went two perfectly good men!)</p>
<p class="italic">The elevator reaches the lower floor, and another pair of soldiers appears.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier 3</b><br/>OK! Back to work!! Back to work!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier 4</b><br/>Yawn... I'm sleepy!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier 3</b><br/>For Junon!!</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud and the others continue on, go down another elevator, and pass through the underwater pipe to the reactor. They cross a catwalk above the submarine dock and fight their way through the reactor.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldiers in Reactor</b><br/>You, you're Cloud!!<br/>You are NOT getting this Huge Materia!!<br/>So you WERE after the Huge Materia!</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud and the others reach where the Huge Materia is stored.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>!? The Huge Materia!</p>

  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Submarine Operation Manual - Beginner's Edition</b></p>
  <p class="italic-inline-nopad">A button controls reference is provided.</p>
  <p class="block-inline-nopad">Mission Orders: Presently on the ocean floor near Junon, a Red Leader Submarine carrying Huge Materia is being escorted by covert Shinra Submarine Units.<br/>Furthermore, it has been confirmed that several mines have been dispersed onto the ocean floor.<br/>The ocean floor can only be monitored with Shinra's Sonar Radar Screen.<br/>Enemy subs can only be detected with the Sonar area. Get in front of the detected enemy sub and "Lock On"!!<br/>Push [] button to fire the torpedo!<br/>The mines are found on the radar screen at the top of the indicators. The mines inflict great damage, so be careful!<br/>Objective: Sink the Red Leader Submarine carrying the Huge Materia! Time Limit: 10 minutes!<br/>Advice<br/>1. Get the enemy submarine in front of you!<br/>2. Concentrate attack on the Red Leader Submarine!<br/>3. If you lose track of the enemy, push the R1 button and use your radar!</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Submarine Operation Manual - Intermediate's Edition</b><br/>Radar Screen: The mines are found at the top of the indicators on the screen.<br/>The basic strategies are to 1) avoid the indicators, and 2) "Lock On" to enemies from behind.<br/>The lower gauge shows the sub's remaining power. The right gauge shows the sub's speed. Other warnings are as follows...<br/>WARNING... Enemy submarine detected nearby!<br/>ALERT... Approaching torpedo detected!<br/>MINE... Mine detected nearby!<br/>CONFLICT... Collisison with the ocean floor!</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Submarine Operation Manual - Advanced Edition</b></p>
  <p class="italic-inline-nopad">A button controls reference is provided.</p>
  <p class="block-inline-nopad">How to release the "Lock On" mode: If the sub leaves the center of the sonar screen, the "Lock On" mode will reset.<br/>When Locked On by an enemy torpedo: Shift up to maximum speed by pressing [triangle] button repeatedly.<br/>This will enable you to speed up past the maximum speed and outrun the torpedo! ...That is all.</p>
