<p class="italic"><a name="sector5"></a>If Cloud returns to Midgar, there is a person standing outside the gate to Sector 5.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Person</b><br/>That's funny... did I drop the key to this gate... somewhere? Was it when I was on that excavation tour?</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud can dig for and obtain the key up in Bone Village. He can then return and enter Sector 5. In Aeris's church, two kids stand near the flower bed...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Boy</b><br/>They're purty!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Girl</b><br/>Hey! Where's the flower lady?</p>
<p class="italic">Elsewhere in Sector 5...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Person Outside the Pipe</b><br/>These folks went wobbling off somewhere...<br/>They said something about the 'Reunion starting'... sounded almost like a chant. Wonder what the heck that meant.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Woman Walking Around</b><br/>I'm not going to look up or down! From now on I'm just going to look straight ahead.<br/>Maybe not. I'm just flapping my gums. I really wonder how things will turn out.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Person in Blue</b><br/>What's going on with the world? When it's all said and done, we're all gonna wind up dead.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man in Straw Hat</b><br/>Yeah, that's right! But, even so, where could we move to now...?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Person in Blue</b><br/>...You've been talking like that for sometime now.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Materia Shopkeeper</b><br/>And I just got together enough money to get out of this place...<br/>Now it doesn't matter where I go! Ho, ho, ho...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Item Shopkeeper</b><br/>...stare... ......hmph... we only trade items for gil here. No matter what.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Weapons Shopkeeper</b><br/>I don't know crap about crap! But I do know one thing.<br/>The one thing that you'll always need is a good strong weapon!</p>
<p class="italic">Inside a house...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>TV</b><br/>......ga...... g, ga ga..............</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Kid</b><br/>SOLDIER? What about them!?<br/>Damn! If they really were from SOLDIER, they would be doing something about all this!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man Upstairs</b><br/>The trick to bein' a real man, is not to fart around, but to let everyone know where you stand, right off!</p>
<p class="italic"><a name="sector6"></a>Sector 6, Wall Market. A soldier stands guard outside the Honey Bee Inn...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier</b><br/>Heee, ...... The Shinra have occupied this shop!</p>
<p class="italic">Inside the automated item store, if Cid and Tifa are in the party...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Hmm? Let me see that.</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He messes with the machine, then turns to Tifa.</p>
<p class="block-inline">It should work now. Go on, try and use it now.</p>
<p class="italic">Tifa presses a button on the machine, and a bright light flashes red.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Cid! What did you do!?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Don't get mad, you'll just get more wrinkles. Hey, something's comin' out.</p>
<div class="highlight-nopad"><p>Received "Premium Heart"!</p></div>

<p class="indent"><b>Cat Kid</b><br/>I wish I could live with a real cat.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Punk</b><br/>We're not leavin' this city no matter what happens.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man Outside Restaurant</b><br/>It's a weird world we live in, so eat up and work hard.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man Cooking Outside</b><br/>I don't know what's gonna happen next, But first, you gatta fill your stomach.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man Outside Dress Shop</b><br/>Seems like everything has frills on it.</p>
<p class="italic">Inside the gym...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man Using Punching Bag</b><br/>These days, you've got to have strength. Come on, you should work out.</p>
<p class="italic">In the Weapons Shop...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Weapons Shop Owner</b><br/>Oh, so you're back? I got something good for you. Why don't you buy it?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>You probably just found it lying around somewhere, right?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Weapons Shop Owner</b><br/>I'll admit that I found it, but you may never be able to get another one like it again.<br/>How 'bout 129,000 Gil for it?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>...What kind of price is that?<br/>- Oh, all right... I'll buy it<br/>- No, I don't want it</p>
<div class="block">
  <p><span class="highlight">Oh, all right... I'll buy it</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Weapons Shop Owner</b><br/>Hey, much obliged. You'll never regret it!</p>
  <p class="italic-inline-nopad">Or, if you don't have enough money:</p>

  <div class="highlight-nopad"><p>Received "Sneak Glove"!</p></div>

<p class="italic"><a name="kalm"></a>At Kalm...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Redhead</b><br/>Listen to me! Something really big's happening in Midgar.<br/>They were just saying on TV it was Rufus second strategy and...<br/>That big cannon's pointed due north...... You think the target's...... Sephiroth?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man</b><br/>Sephiroth put up a huge barrier around the North Crater.<br/>Rufus wants to use a mammoth cannon to smash the barrier.<br/>He plans to have Shinra troops rush in and attack Sephiroth after the barrier falls.</p>
<p class="italic">Inside the second house...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Old Man</b><br/>Everyone at Shinra's in an uproar because they heard Weapon's coming.<br/>I heard a big hydroplane carrying secret weapons, got attacked by Weapon and was sunk at sea......</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic"><a name="junon"></a>At Lower Junon...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Woman</b><br/>I heard a war's about to start! And that's why they're moving the big cannon!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Older Man</b><br/>Listen Cloud, I'm over the hill, but Priscilla is still a child.<br/>Isn't there a way to protect at least her from Meteor?</p>
<p class="italic">In Upper Junon...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier</b><br/>The Shinra Army's gathered at Midgar. Now it's just a matter of time Sephiroth's dead.<br/>What... me? I don't mind. I'll just wait here. My life is important to me.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier Guarding the Respectable Inn</b><br/>Hmmm? Back again, Mr. Know-it-all!?<br/>All right! You can enter!!</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic"><a name="costa"></a>At Costa del Sol...</p>
<p class="italic">Johnny's House...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Johnny</b><br/>No, no, NO!! Meteor's getting bigger by the minute!!<br/>I wanna live on the edge right now! I want to build a home with my woman and grow old together!<br/>If you can't do it, I will! And that's that!<br/>I'm gonna do my best, so you hang in there, too!</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic"><a name="corel"></a>At North Corel...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man in Hardhat</b><br/>Hey, the Gold Saucer reopened!<br/>We've got to play hard to get our minds of Meteor.</p>
<p class="italic">At the ropeway station...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Redhead</b><br/>I'm gonna use all my life savings before Meteor hits!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Blond</b><br/>I know how you feel, but what if Meteor doesn't hit us? What are you gonna do then?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Station Man</b><br/>The Gold Saucer reopened. Why don't you go play hard and clear your heads as well as your pockets?</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic"><a name="gold"></a>At Gold Saucer...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Dio</b><br/>I thought about it, but there was only one conclusion.<br/>I believed that because of the way things are, there's a need for a place like this.<br/>Enjoy yourselves... Ha ha ha ha...</p>
<p class="italic">Occasionally, a man will appear standing by the house in back of the ropeway.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man</b><br/>Hey, how 'bout it, change your gil into GP?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Yeah<br/>- Not interested</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man</b><br/>Hey, thanks 1 GP is 100 gil.<br/>Is x gil okay?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Yeah<br/>- No</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man</b><br/>If you want some more later, I'll be around now and then.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Ester</b><br/>Hey, long time no see... How have you been?<br/>There's a lot going on in the world outside.<br/>It got a little lonely around here, but you can't keep a jockey from doing what he loves.<br/>How 'bout it, you want to ride again? You have your own Chocobo, right?<br/>Do you want to ride?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Let me register<br/>- Tell me how to ride it<br/>- Don't do it</p>

  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Ester</b><br/>I'll register this C/B/A/S rank Chocobo.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Yeah<br/>- I changed my mind, don't do it</p>

<div class="block">
  <p><span class="highlight">Tell me how to ride it</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Ester</b><br/>Oh, you forgot? It's all right. Ahem!<br/>First use the [Select] button to choose either AUTO or MANUAL.<br/>In other words, either you control the Chocobo or let it run on its own.<br/>But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen.<br/>You can't really help on this one.<br/>But, most of the Chocobos that I'll provide you with are mellow and you should be able to handle them.<br/>When you're riding, use the [] Button to Speed Up and the X Button to Slow Down.<br/>But, if you go faster than the Chocobo can handle, it'll lose its stamina really fast.<br/>And use the Directional button to move the Chocobo left and right, use the O Button to get a boost of speed.<br/>Of course your stamina runs out faster though.<br/>There are some bad tempered Chocobos that can't pace themselves and they'll lose their stamina pretty fast.<br/>For those kinds of Chocobos, you should set the controls on Manual and slow it down.<br/>Finally, some advice for the restless, once the first and second Chocobo cross the goal line,<br/>Push the [Start] button to end the race.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Black-haired Man</b><br/>Hmmm...<br/>What, you too? With the way things are in the world, It makes you wonder what we're doin' here?<br/>Well, it's a little late for me to run around now, so I do what I love, it works best for me.<br/>Oh, by the way, did you know? I heard that there's going to be a battle and only the strongest will be allowed to participate.<br/>But what do they mean by 'strongest'? If ya ask me I'll say it's 'weapons.'<br/>But, there's gotta be a way to measure this too. Mmm, we need another way to measure strength.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man Practicing Kicks</b><br/>I'll give that Meteor my ultra kick...... ...or...... maybe not.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Registration Lady</b><br/>Those two over there eloped, saying stuff like 'OUr last moments together---' I can't bear it.<br/>I don't have anyone like that in my life so, if something happens, it happens.<br/>...that's why I'm working now. Oh, sorry for going off like that...</p>
<p class="Italic">If Cloud tries to enter the arena without registering...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Registration Lady</b><br/>Um, I'm sorry, that's only for registered participants. You won't be able to go in through there until you come and register.</p>
<p class="italic">By this point, Cloud may be able to access the special duel at the Battle Arena.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Registration Lady</b><br/>You know, I've been thinking about it for a while now, but you must be pretty strong?<br/>Probably strong enough to take on the top 1 or 2 fighters?<br/>Maybe you'll be good enough for the big match......<br/>How 'bout it? There's a private battle only for the strongest. Wanna try?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Let's do it<br/>- Not interested</p>
