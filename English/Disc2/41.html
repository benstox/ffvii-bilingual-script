<h1>Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris</h1>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic">Cloud and his party arrive at Cosmo Canyon and go up to the observatory to see Bugenhagen.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bugenhagen</b><br/>Ho Ho Hoooo. If you ever are in need of my wisdom, you are always welcome here.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Yeah, that's why we came.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bugenhagen</b><br/>What to do? Have you lost your way? When that happens we each have to take a good long look at ourselves.<br/>There's always something in the deepest reaches of our hearts.<br/>Something buried, or something forgotten.<br/>Remember it... Whatever that is, must certainly be what you are all looking for...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>That's easy enough to say... But, I can't remember a thing.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bugenhagen</b><br/>It must be there. Look harder!</p>
<blockquote class="party">
	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Barret</b><br/>This ain't no good with just us! Cloud, we gotta get some others in here.</p>
	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Tifa</b><br/>...no good. Cloud, let's have the others come.</p>
	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>nghh... no good. We alone cannot do it. We need to have the others here.</p>
	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>You expect me to know that? Let the others do it!</p>
	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>How about it, Cloud? Shouldn't we have the others come?</p>
	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Vincent</b><br/>I don't know, Cloud. I think we should have everyone here.</p>
	<p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cid</b><br/>Ahh, no good. Cloud you call the others in here too!</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="italic">Cloud nods and calls up the others on his PHS. They all gather in the observatory.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bugenhagen</b><br/>Do you see it? What is it that you are searching for?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>Nope. Not a thing. Naw. Can't come up with a thing.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>Me either! I don't get any of this!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>I remember Aeris a lot.<br/>No... not that.<br/>You haven't remembered.<br/>You haven't forgotten.<br/>That's not it...<br/>How would you say it... Aeris was right there all along. Right by our side.<br/>She was so close, we couldn't see her. What Aeris did... The words she left behind...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>That reminds me... I was the same.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>......as was I.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Me too...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>She said she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth's Meteor.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>But Aeris is gone.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>Is it impossible for us to carry on... what Aeris tried to accomplish?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>We ain't no Ancients, if that's what ya mean.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>What, did that girl go off to that place?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>That's it!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>What's it?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>We don't know about it.<br/>What did Aeris know?<br/>Why did she face Sephiroth without running away?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>I see... She returned there once again, correct?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bugenhagen</b><br/>Hmmm. Perhaps I'll have you take me there.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>You're going too?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bugenhagen</b><br/>What's so surprising about that...?<br/>Even I want to get out from time to time and see the outside world. I wonder what did it? I haven't felt like this in ages.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>It must be the planet. The planet is calling you!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Yeah, hoo boy, the planet calling... right.</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He walks out.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bugenhagen</b><br/>Ho Ho Hoooo. Then let's go.</p>
<p class="italic">The others all file out ahead of Cloud and Bugenhagen.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Oh yeah, Bugenhagen. I have one more thing I want to ask you.<br/>We're carrying around Huge Materia. This is pretty delicate stuff and we would like to keep it in a safe place...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bugenhagen</b><br/>Ho Ho Hoooo. Then we'll put it upstairs. Now, shall we be on our way?<br/>I'll teach you how to work the machine. Watch carefully now. You just pull this here...</p>
<p class="italic">The machine turns on, raising the platform into the planetarium. The Huge Materia Cloud has collected now hover amidst the model of the solar system.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bugenhagen</b><br/>Ho Ho Hoooo. Is this what you call Huge Materia...?<br/>This is really rare Materia, indeed.<br/>Materia this rare is certain to have a special consciousness enclosed in it.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Huge Materia...<br/>It is glowing strangely...<br/>- Get closer...<br/>- Leave it alone<br/>- Go back down</p>
<p class="italic">On approaching the green Huge Materia:</p>
<div class="highlight"><p>The Huge Materia emitted a gentle glow.</p></div>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>This color... it's the same color as magic Materia.</p>
<p class="italic">On approaching the yellow Huge Materia:</p>
<div class="highlight"><p>The Huge Materia emitted a quiet glow.</p></div>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>This color... it's the same color as command Materia.</p>
<p class="italic">On approaching the red Huge Materia:</p>
<div class="highlight"><p>The Huge Materia emitted a fiery glow.</p></div>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>This color... it's the same color as summoned Materia.</p>
<p class="italic">On approaching the blue Huge Materia:</p>
<div class="highlight"><p>The Huge Materia emitted a cold glow.</p></div>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Is that... Bahamut...?</p>
<p class="italic">Once Cloud decides to go back down...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bugenhagen</b><br/>Ho Ho Hoooo. Good. Now let's leave.<br/>Do you remember how to use the machine down below? If you ever want to see Materia, come here anytime.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic">Back on the Highwind, Bugenhagen hovers outside the Operation room.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bugenhagen</b><br/>Hm, hmm, hmm!.......<br/>Smells like machinery.<br/>I love this smell.<br/>Of course, I also love the smell of nature, too......<br/>Hm? Is the deck up there?<br/>Then I'll be on the deck just passing the time.<br/>I can feel the workings of the planet in the smell of the wind.<br/>I also feel the greatness of man's wisdom and the knowledge in the smell of machinery...<br/>Well, bye for now.</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He floats off to the deck above.</p>
<p class="block-inline">I wonder where you're taking me?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Yuffie</b><br/>Cloud...... urp...... ugh.<br/>You know, I was thinking...... phew...... Why does materia always have something to do with battles or magic?<br/>I bet the Ancients must've always been fighting.<br/>It must've been... ugh... terrible...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>And Aeris... she's dead.<br/>Guess she turned into spiritual energy and returned to the planet, huh?<br/>But even if she did, there's no way we'll meet her again...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>I wonder what Aeris felt... when she was on that altar...?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>I'm sure she wanted to give her life for the planet...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Tifa</b><br/>Really? I wonder? I don't think that's it at all.<br/>I think she didn't think she would die at all, but that she planned on coming back all along.<br/>She always used to talk about the 'Next time'.<br/>She talked about the future more than any of us...<br/>Although she never talked about it to us she must've had a rough life...<br/>I think Aeris looked forward to tomorrow and the future more than anyone...<br/>...she must've had many many dreams......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>Aeris used to pat me on the nose sometimes.<br/>I used to hate being treated like a child like that, but I also liked the attention.<br/>I wanted to apologize to her for what I did when we first met.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cait Sith</b><br/>I went an' told Aeris' Mom about her death.<br/>Yes, an' Miss Elmyra was cryin' herself silly... So was little Marlene...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Vincent</b><br/>City of the Ancients...<br/>The Ancients... after a long time that is probably what others will come to call us...<br/>Hmmm... hwa ha ha ha... It's only a matter of time for us.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cid</b><br/>Aeris...?<br/>I wanted to give her a ride in the Highwind......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Learner Pilot (LV11)</b><br/>Okay then, let's go!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Let's go!<br/>- Wait a sec......</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud and the others set out for the City of the Ancients.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p class="italic">If you speak to some of the villagers while Bugenhagen is with the party...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Elder Hargo</b> (in the observatory)<br/>I hope great Bugenhagen will take care and not overexert himself.<br/>'Ho Ho Hoooo.' I may be light, But I'm not as young as Nanaki.<br/>Oops. That will only get you angry. You're just like me. Ho ho ho.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Kid in Nanaki's Room</b><br/>Both Nanaki and Mr. Bugenhagen are gone... I feel so lonely...</p>
<p class="italic-inline">Or, if Nanaki is in the party:</p>
<p class="block-inline">That Nanaki's slick! He said, 'I'll protect this canyon'! But he didn't. I don't care about Nanaki anymore...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>Sorry... I'm really sorry. But now, I have......</p>
