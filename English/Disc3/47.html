<p class="indent"><b>Redhead</b><br/>Hey, listen to me! I heard the barrier protecting Sephiroth is gone!<br/>But with Rufus dead, the Shinra troops don't know what to do. Heidegger and Scarlet don't have what it takes to lead the troops......<br/>I really thought something was finally going to get done, but everything's the same... not a damn thing's changed!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Old Man</b><br/>Ah, youth... You really believe that big meteor filling up the sky's going to fall here?<br/>If Shinra, Inc was our last hope, and they've been beaten by terrorists...... Are we all going to die?</p>
