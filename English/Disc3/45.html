<h1>Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell</h1>
<hr></hr>
<p class="indent"><b>Gatekeeper</b></p>
<p class="italic-inline">If Nanaki is not in the party:</p>
<p class="block-inline">Bugenhagen seems rather down ever since he returned from that trip.<br/>I'm worried something might happen to Bugenhagen now of all times...</p>
<p class="italic-inline">If Nanaki is in the party:</p>
<p class="block-inline">Nanaki, it's really bad. Ever since Bugenhagen returned from that last trip, he doesn't seem well.<br/>Why don't you hurry and see Bugenhagen?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Elder Bugah</b><br/>Where is the Promised Land...? Maybe Bugenhagen knows.<br/>Isn't Nanaki starting to notice? The reason why Bugenhagen sent him away from the canyon...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Kid in Nanaki's Room</b><br/>He's finally come home, but Mr. Bugenhagen doesn't seem well...<br/>I want to hear Mr. Bugenhagen's talk with Nanaki like we used to do...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Elder Hargo</b><br/>I think Bugenhagen has foreseen it.<br/>About the planet... About Nanaki... And, about himself...<br/>But, Bugehnagen would never say that. All he says is 'Ho Ho Hoooo'...</p>
<p class="italic">In the living quarters next to the materia shop...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Kid</b><br/>What's wrong with Bugenhagen? Is he sick?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Woman</b><br/>No need to be sad, even if something should happen. Everything will return to the planet... Bugenhagen says so.<br/>Just the thought of something happening to Bugenhagen... worries me.</p>
<p class="italic">If Cloud visits the observatory without Nanaki, he finds Bugenhagen lying on the sofa.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bugenhagen</b><br/>Ho Ho...... Hoooo. You......?<br/>It's been a while... since I've been out. I think I must have... tired myself out a bit.<br/>Ahh...... don't tell Nanaki. He'll only worry...</p>
<p class="italic">If Nanaki is in the party, then once they enter the observatory, he runs ahead of the others.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>Grandfather!!</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud holds out a hand to stop the other party member and shakes his head. They leave Nanaki alone with Bugenhagen.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>Grandfather!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bugenhagen</b><br/>...Nanaki...? ...you're still...... here?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>I can't leave you like this, grandfather...!<br/>It's the duty of my... Seto's son, to guard this canyon and her people...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bugenhagen</b><br/>...listen, Nanaki. I think you may already know.<br/>If you have any mission in life, it is not to defend this valley.<br/>Look at the withering mountain grass. Listen to the warble of the new born chocobo's.<br/>Look always to the eternal flow of time which is far greater than the span of a human life.<br/>It will teach you more, than staying here in the valley...<br/>What you will see will eventually become a part of life's dream.<br/>For my children...... And for your children......<br/>So please, Nanaki... Go with Cloud... And with your eyes... your ears...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>.........</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bugenhagen</b><br/>Ho Ho...... Hoooo. Now, now. Don't look like that. I'm all right.<br/>It's a wide world and you must go out and see it... You may even find your life's mate. You never know.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>Grandfather......</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Bugenhagen</b><br/>Oh yes... take this along. I think it will look good on you now.<br/>Ho Ho......</p>
<p class="italic">He slumps back, and Nanaki jumps up, putting his forepaws on the sofa. Fade to black.</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud is waiting at the bonfire. He stands when Nanaki arrives.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Nanaki... Is Bugenhagen...?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>......<br/>Grandpa told me that he's going away again!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Away...?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>It seems like he really liked that Airship.<br/>He told me he couldn't stay still and just zipped out of here!<br/>He even gave me a gift, look!</p>
<div class="highlight"><p>Received "Limited Moon"!</p></div>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>Wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to give gifts AFTER you come back?<br/>Ha ha...... Grandpa sure is strange! Haa... ha ha...... ha......</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He shakes his head.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Hmm... So maybe we'll run into him again somewhere.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>Yeah... maybe...<br/>Thanks, Cloud......</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud shakes his head.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Kid in Nanaki's Room</b><br/>Nanaki, is it true that Mr. Bugenhagen left on a journey? Then that means he's better, right? He IS going to come back soon, right?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Nanaki</b><br/>......<br/>...Don't worry. Grandpa will come back floating, saying 'Ho Ho Hoooo' again...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Kid in Nanaki's Room</b><br/>Yea, that's right! 'Ho Ho Hoooo'!<br/>It's Ho Ho Hoooo! Ho Ho Hoooo!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Gatekeeper</b><br/>Bugenhagen is what keeps our hearts strong... </p>
